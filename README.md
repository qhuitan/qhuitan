I am a computational and molecular biologist. My current areas of expertise include transcriptomics (bulk and single cell), cancer biology, _Drosophila_, and Wnt signaling. 

📦 __My R packages:__

* :chart_with_downwards_trend: {[ggbulksurv](https://github.com/qhuitan/ggbulksurv)} - Easy survival analysis for _Drosophila_ and _C.elegans_

📝 __My projects:__
* 🪰 {[otkwnt_embryo](https://github.com/harmstonlab/otkwnt_embryo)}: Bulk RNA-seq analysis of otk1, otk2 and wnt4 in _Drosophila_ embryo
* 🐭 {[deaf1](https://github.com/harmstonlab/Goh_et_al_deaf1)}: ChIP-seq analysis of Deaf1 in C2C12 mouse myoblasts
